Hi! My name is Henry Bayly. I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Biostatistics at Boston University. My research interests lie mainly in the holistic understanding of neurological disorders; particularly PTSD and Alzheimer's. I also work to develop methods that allow for the safe deployment of machine learning models in high-risk settings. Outside of my academic life, I really like to run. I recently ran my first ultra-marathon and will likely continue to run more. At some point I will add a tab that tracks races with some fun pictures.

This site is built using the Academic Pages template and hosted on GitHub Pages. The template is powered by Jekyll and GitHub, meaning all content is stored in structured markdown and YAML files, ensuring that the site is lightweight, version-controlled, and easy to update. This data-driven approach enables dynamic features like automatically generated CVs, talk maps, and publication listsâ€”all maintained directly through commits to the GitHub repository.
