Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics at Boston University, where I specialize in developing interpretable and reliable machine learning methods for complex biomedical problems. I completed my undergraduate studies at Boston College in 2022, majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science. That fall, I began my doctoral training at BU.

My research lies at the intersection of statistical methodology, machine learning, and neuroscience. Much of my applied work centers around neurocognitive disorders—particularly Alzheimer’s Disease and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder—where I aim to build models that uncover meaningful patterns in high-dimensional, often imbalanced clinical data. I’m especially interested in how ensemble methods and interpretable ML can be tailored to support decision-making in sensitive biomedical contexts.

Outside of academia, I’ve become something of a reluctant runner turned enthusiast. I grew up playing basketball and dreaded running unless it was part of a drill. That all changed two years ago when I signed up for a mountain half marathon. The solitude, challenge, and serenity I found running through the mountains completely shifted my perspective. Since then, I’ve taken part in a handful of adventurous races and am currently training for a backyard ultra marathon this August!
